# Forge Engine

This is a lightweight game engine, which uses raymarching as the primary rendering method. Raymarching allows for unique manipulation of shapes and cool effects which would be complex to implement in non-SDF based engines. It is heavily based on the legendary work of Inigo Quilez (definitely check out their work).

## How to run

1. Run `make forge`
2. Run `./build/forge`
